    <h1>Presidential Initiative
        for Artificial Intelligence and Computing </h1>
        <p>Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (PIAIC) is privately funded not for profit education Initiative started by President of Pakistan , Dr.Arif Alvi,Qazi Rahat Ali,and Zia Khan to promote education research and bussiness contribution in emerging tech fields like </p>

        <h2>Cloud Native Computing</h2>
        <p>
            Cloud native computing uses open-source software stacks to deploy applications as microservices, packaging each part into its own container and dynamically orchestrating those containers to optimize resource utilization. In the last 15 years, cloud application delivery has moved from being bound to physical servers to running on virtual machines with a full operating system and now to containers with Docker, where developers can specify every aspect of deployment.

        </p>
<h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<p>
    The Artificial Intelligence program of PIAIC takes the student through the foundation of the AI technology ,via teaching programming in open source language like <strong><em> Python Numpy Pandas Techsorflow 2.0 and flask </em></strong>and teaching deploying practical AI solution and use cases and ending with real-life examples of modren AI practice
</p>
<h2>Block Chain</h2>
<p>In this module, students will get an introduction to digital money, bitcoin and the blockchain. Students will learn about trestles systems and proof of work. Students will also learn the difference between private, consortium, and public blockchain networks. This module will also provide an introduction to hashing and cryptography.
</p>
<h2>Internet of Things</h2>
<p>This course will start by providing a definition of the term. We will talk about how various trends have enabled the Internet of Things, and how it changes the way programming is done. We will also discuss some of the ramifications that IoT is having on society today.
